Possible to access MVC ViewBag object from Javascript file?

Or if it's not a class, your only other alternative, is to use data attributes in your HTML elements, assign them to properties in your View and retrieve them in the JS file.

Assuming you had this input:

<input type="hidden" id="myInput" data-myValue="@ViewBag.MyValue" />


Then in your JS file you could get it by using:

var myVal = $("#myInput").data("myValue");
